# FinalProject
Project on Information Spread

The file runs from the main.py, and it generates the files that are then passed on the visualizer.py to make the graphs. 
The visualizer.py has to be done manually at the moment, and you have to change which files it is reading from (I couldn't get
the package I was using to not do weird stuff when I was doing it differently).

Most of the functionality is in grid.py, but a fair amount of it is in agent.py where approriate. The way you run it is really
intuitive though. You just have to run the run method on your grid object and specify how many rounds it has to go for.
Functions are prety throughly documented if you have any questions.
